# Learning Decentralized Controllers for Robot Swarms with Graph Neural Networks
## Ekaterina Tolstaya, Fernando Gama, James Paulos, George Pappas, VIjay Kumar, Alejandro Ribeiro

* Use GNNs to do decentralized control for the flocking problem with large numbers of robots. 
* Do this through imitaiton learning of a centralized policy.
* Extend GNN to operate over time-varying graphs
* show that using 3-4 hops you can makea  good policy.
