# Decentralized Minimum-Energy Coverage Control
for Time-Varying Density Functions
## Maria Santos, Siddharth Mayya, Gennaro Notomista, and Magnus Egerstedt

* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8901076
* Trying to distribute robots in a coverage problem over an area
* Able to mimick perfectly a centroidal voronoi tesselation by running a decentralized controller, even with time-varying density function 
* Use a constraint-based strategy - minimum energy optimization program executed by each robot, with slack variables to ensure feasibility 
* Not the same as the globally optimal solution
* Wonder if coverage problems can just be solved optimally with MC approximations lol
